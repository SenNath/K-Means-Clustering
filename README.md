# K-Means-Clustering
Clusters the data points in an n dimensional space with number of clusters demanded and writes out the centroid of each cluster in an output text file. 

The code takes in a text file specifying the data points in D dimensional space along with number of clusters demanded and should write out the centroid of the clusters in an output text file.

Example format of text file will be (for 3 dimension) - 

0.1 0.4 0.2 
0.6 0.1 0.5 
0.4 1.6 0.9 
1.2 3.4 6.5 
9.2 9.6 8.6

The code infers the dimension as well as the number of data points given. Also it should take in number of cluster point that the user wants.
